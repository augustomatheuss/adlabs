# Arithmetic examples. 

## Example 1. Floating point multiplication  
```
PI=3.14
r=5.0
echo "2 * $PI * $r" | bc -l
```  

# Interactions with the user  

## Example 1. Ask the user Y/n  
```
read ok  
if [ "$ok" = "Y" ]; then ok="y";fi  
if [ "$ok" = "y" ]  
then  
	echo "Do something!"  
fi  
```

# Awk command examples.  

## Example 1. Cut column 5.  
```
awk '{print $5}' 
```

## Example 2. Cut columns 1 and 2.  
```
awk '{print $1, $2}'
```

## Example 3. Get the line 16 from a file my-file.txt.  
```
awk NR==16 my-file.txt
```
# General examples.  

## Example 1. Get the number of columns in terminal  
```
$(tput cols)
```  

## Example 4. Take a screenshot (run the command and click in the target screen)  
```
xwd | xwdtopnm | pnmtopng > capture.png
```

# Run by name examples.

## Example 1. Running the script just by the name

* You first line in file should be the line bellow  
```
#!/bin/bash
```
* Put the script in the directory /usr/bin or other directory in the $PATH variable, and give execute permission
```
cp your-script /usr/bin/
chmod 755 /usr/bin/your-script
```  
# Search files and expressions examples.  

## Example 1. Get largest file in a directory  
```
'$(ls the-directory --sort=size | head -n 1)'
```  

## Example 2. Get text between the parentesis  
```
grep -Po '(?<=\().*(?=\))' 
```

## Example 3. Find file with expression inside current directory or subs  
```
grep -r . -e "the-expression"
```

## Example 4. Example 3 with types of file in specific (C code in example)  
```
grep --include=\*.{c,h} -r . -e "the-expression"
```

## Example 5. Get n lines before every result in file search  
```
grep -B n "the-pattern"  
```

## Example 6. Get n lines after every result in file search  
```
grep -A n "the-pattern"  
```

## Example 7. Get n lines arround (context) every result in file search  
```
grep -C n "the-pattern"  
```  

## Example 8. Search all files inside a directory and shred them.  
## In this example all regular files with ".jp" in the name will be shred 5 times and rewritten with zeros (verbose mode).  
```
sudo find `pwd` -type f -name "*.jp*" | xargs sudo shred -n 5 -z -v
```

# Test command examples.  

## Example 1. Test if the file exists.  
```
if (test -e the-file)  
then   
  echo "Do something!"  
fi
```
# Users, login and auth examples.  

## Example 1. See all users in the system.  
```
awk -F':' '{ print $1}' /etc/passwd
```

## Example 2. See all users logged.  
```
w
```
# Wait and sleep examples.  

## Example 1.  Wait n seconds. 
```
sleep n  
```

## Example 2. Watch with loop (n seconds of interval).  
```
while true; do clear; your-command; sleep n; done; 
```
