# coffeetime
Code and schematic to use a coffee maker with an alarm clock.  
  
Use an Arduino UNO/DUEMILANOVE to turn on a coffee maker with an alarm clock.  
  
The code program the following MCUs: ATmega48A-PA-88A-PA-168A-PA-328-P.  

The program needs Python and pyserial.  

See the schematic in "hardware".

Connect the Arduino, upload the code(coffeetime.c) and run coffetime.py.
