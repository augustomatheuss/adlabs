## My classes' courseware

# How it's organized?

* Each class has a code with three letters (the area) and three numbers (the class number).
    * Example: ANN001 is the class 1 in artificial neural networks.
* There is a folder by area.
* Each class can be:
    * a markdown text file
    * a jupyter notebook
    * a software
    * a pdf file
    * a video
	* a folder with several files
